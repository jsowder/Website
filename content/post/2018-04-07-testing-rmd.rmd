```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(tufte)
# invalidate cache when the tufte version changes
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, cache.extra = packageVersion('tufte'))
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

`r tufte::margin_note("![neural-network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg/300px-Colored_neural_network.svg.png)")` 

This is to test the `tufte` packages integration with this `hugo-envisioned` blogdown theme. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '980566101124722688')
```

Now let's try some R code:

```{r, code-test}
head(iris, 3) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "Iris dataset")
```

This is an attempt at a margin figure... 

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual'))

ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

Every few weeks in 2017 there was a new breakthrough application of neural networks. If you're reading this, then I probably don't need to list them. So eventually the ridiculous general ability of these algorithms encouraged me to dig in, so by the end of 2017 I decided it was time to jump on the deep learning bandwagon. This was just around the same time [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/) was launched by Andrew Ng. Given Ng's reputation, it was a no brainer that this set of courses was the way forward.

## Trying to render 

```{marginfigure}
We know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$$
```

Here comes a full width figure!

```{r fig-fullwidth, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "A full width figure.", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```

This figure goes in the main column

```{r fig-main, fig.cap = "A figure in the main column.", cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{marginfigure}
This is a margin figure processed by knitr please god...
```
