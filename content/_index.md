Thanks for dropping in. 

You're here, which means I likely applied to work with you. Happy to be under you consideration -- and looking forward to teaming up.

I am an early-career analyst & developer who can solve your problems. I build models, reports, APIs, websites, and whatever else you need. Head over to my [resume](/resume.pdf) for more.

You may notice a strange hole in my timeline -- last year, I left my job to travel around Europe and North Africa. I wanted to learn about the world I live in, and take the opportunities that I have at this point in life. I'd love to talk with you about that and anything else.

In the meantime, stay well!
