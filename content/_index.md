title: About Me

Thanks for dropping in. 

You're here, which means I likely applied to work with you. Happy to be under you consideration -- and looking forward to teaming up.

I am an early-career analyst & developer who can solve your problems. I build models, reports, APIs, websites, and whatever else you need.

When I'm not at work, I listen to audiobooks and cook unhealthy meals.

You may have noticed a strange hole in my resume -- last year, I left my job to travel around Europe and North Africa. I wanted to learn about the world I live in, and take the opportunities that I have at this point in life. I'd love to talk about that and anything else.

In the meantime, stay well. Let's hope we talk soon.
